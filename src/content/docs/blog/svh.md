A beta version of *Stécker vum Himmel*, a Tetris-clone powered by the bell0bytes game engine, was
just [released on itch.io](https://symplectos.itch.io/svh).

### Gameplay Features

#### The Oracle

As long as the oracle is active, the landing position (if left alone) of the currently active Tetronimo is displayed on
the board.

#### Shift / Switch

An unwanted Tetronimo can be switched for the *next* Tetronimo. This can't be done twice in a row, though.
