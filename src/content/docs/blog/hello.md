As a result of no longer having the time to maintain a blog,
it was decided to archive the knowledge acquired during the journey of the bell0bytes project into a knowledge base. 

The pages and articles from the old bell0bytes blog will slowly, but steadily, be made available in the knowledge base.

As a side note, but importantly,
the ecological footprint of the new site is much, much lower than the footprint of the previous bell0bytes blog.
